My new year's resolution for 2022 is to write more - both as a way to organise my thoughts and to document the things I learn. I truly believe that learning is a lifelong endeavour, but it's difficult to know where you're going if you can't see where you've been. My hope is that this blog will allow me to look back at the progress I've made. Watch this space!
